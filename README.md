I am a 2025 Computer Science Graduate currently working at Infracloud Technologies - An Improving company as an Associate Site Reliability Engineer (ASRE) Intern. I am passionate about cloud and Devops and worked as a Devops Intern at two startups, followed by an internship at Cognizant Technology Solutions, where I recieved structured training on various Devops Tools and Microsoft Azure. 

I have earned a diverse set of certifications, including:
1) AWS Cloud Practitioner
2) Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)
3) Hashicorp Terraform Associate
4) Microsoft Technical Certication in Python
5) Microsoft Office Certifications include Word, Access, Excel and Powerpoint

My goal is to work hands-on with cloud-native technologies and use Devops practices to build reliable, scalable and fault-tolerant systems. I'm looking to be more involved with the open source community and learn to contribute to open-source projects using industry best practices.
